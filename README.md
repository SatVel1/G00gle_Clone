This is a simple clone of google. Technologies used to write this app are React.js and Tailwind.css. To get the data for the google searches, the Google Search API was utilized from RapidAPI. Functionalities include dark/light mode changes, news, video, image, and general searches (exactly like google, with some missing functionality).
